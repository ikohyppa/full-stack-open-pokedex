I picked Java as case language. There seems to be a variety of tool for Java CI development. I would pick Maven for building. There is a GitHub Actions guide "Building and testing Java with Maven" that would be a good place to start. Furthermore, Maven supports linting with Checkstyle and testing with JUnit which seem to to popular choices and have plenty of tutorials available.

There are many alternatives for a continuous Integration Tools for Java. Recomended CI tools include Bamboo, TeamCity, GitLab, Circle CI, Buddy, Travis CI, Shippable, Buildkite, and more. These have different advantages and disadvantages. For example, some work only with specific repository management platforms and do not have support for all os platforms. There are also differences in pricing.

My first option would be a cloud-based environment. I think that is would be faster to set up and maintain. Group of six developers seems small enough for a cloud-based option to work fluently since coincidental pushing to pipeline would not be occur too often. However, if there is prior experience of setting up self-hosted CI setups among the group of developers, my pick would be self-hosted CI environment. In that case setting up a custom CI environment just right for the project and picking right hardware for it should be feasible in reasonable time.
